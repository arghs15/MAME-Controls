1. Copy MAME Controls.pyw to mame directory

2. Create preview folder

3. Create settings folder in preview folder

4. Add gamedata.json to settings folder

5. Add default.png to preview folder

6. Add fonts folder to mame dir, and place fonts inside

NOTE, prompt to add new font if directory empty. If you browse to a fint, and select it, it will create the fonts dir with the font inside and aply it in the app
click save, and it will create the text_appearance_settings.json in the settings folder
NOTE, Add fonts folder to preview\settings to-do list

7. Text positioning using global_positioning.json has hardcoded default sin the script. A file also gets created for no names 
NOTE, no names gets saved to global_positions_no_names and when you save global in preview with names, it saves to global_positioning.json
still odd that no names is default on first run, but there's no global_positions_no_names.json only global_positions.json
Some odd logic going on. Add to to do

8. Info files needs a default.cfg file but there's not one by default. user needs to add one. App does create a info directory though
NOTE, Add moving info folder to preview\settings to to-do list

9. In Game Toggle doesnt really do anything - what was it there for?

Everything else appears to work as it should
