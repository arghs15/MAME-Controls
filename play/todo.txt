-Also analyse button has a tkinter type theme. Might be easier going forward to edit the whole gui, and I may delete tkinter and only use this. Simplifies things.

Text Settings
-show all xinput and then normal controls sets a default font. exit, and re-enter shows correct font

-Gradient no longer dynamically updates and have to also exit and re-enter. Sometime it works after you've done it..

-Remove redundant logo code - there's a lot. also, compare old center-left etc logo functions. They may work better.
