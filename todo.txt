Edit Selected Game
-it edits the db file rather than json. 
-also noticed in edit controls section it displays what the db holds - in this case the deleted control I manually edited, but still showed contlr I "deleted" in preview.
This means preview etc., is still using json, but analysis is using db file. Not the intended use.

Global positions
-global_positions is created by default, and no_names added if you save global with no names. Works well, but with names saves to global, but on first run, only global file exists, but defaults to no names... check logic

In Game Toggle
-forgot what this does...

LUA
-unified plugin does not work, and not sure it will
-one boot lua for all mame versions, hence why plugin doesn't work. If I load it in isolation it works, but then other plugins don't load. best to leave CC Mame as is, and only work with 0.196
-update both mame lua to use newly created params

Hotkey
-hotkey to move preview screen to second screen, and/or hide so you can navigate tab menu
