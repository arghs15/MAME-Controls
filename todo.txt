LUA
-unified plugin now works for both versions.
If version â‰¤ 196: Use "old mode" (MAME 0.196 script)
If version > 196: Use "new mode" (MAME 0.275+ script)
-plugins_MAME_0196_0215_0231 doesnt actually work, but using mameNEW264.exe -autoboot_script controls.lua xmenu   does. must be the boot.lua plugin error...
-need to make it work with other versions. currently 231 doesnt work
-update latest mame lua to use newly created params
-test new mame lua works as it should

Hotkey
-hotkey to move preview screen to second screen, and/or hide so you can navigate tab menu
