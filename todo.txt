Default font
-is set to be arial, but when opening exact preview an error occurs. Could not load font: cannot open resource. fix

LUA
-unified plugin does not work, and not sure it will
-one boot lua for all mame versions, hence why plugin doesn't work. If I load it in isolation it works, but then other plugins don't load. best to leave CC Mame as is, and only work with 0.196
-update both mame lua to use newly created params

Hotkey
-hotkey to move preview screen to second screen, and/or hide so you can navigate tab menu

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=MAME.ico "MAME Controls.pyw"
