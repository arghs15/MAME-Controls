Global positions
-global_positions_no and global_positions_no_names dont appear to have defaults - should add them global_positions does

LUA
-unified plugin does not work, and not sure it will
-one boot lua for all mame versions, hence why plugin doesnt work. If I load it in isolation it works, but then other plugins dont load. best to leave CC Mame as is, and only work with 0.196
-update both mame lua to use newly created params

Hotkey
-hotkey to move preview screen to second screen, and/or hide so you can navigate tab menu
